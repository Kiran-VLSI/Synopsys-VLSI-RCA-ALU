# Synopsys-VLSI-RCA-ALU (RTL to GDSII Flow)

This repository contains two digital design projects—**8-bit Ripple Carry Adder using 1-bit Full Adders** and a **32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**—implemented using **Synopsys EDA tools**. Both designs follow the **complete RTL to GDSII digital IC design flow**, including RTL coding, synthesis, simulation, timing analysis, placement, routing, and final GDSII generation.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 🔧 Project 1: 8-bit Ripple Carry Adder using 1-bit Full Adder

#### 📘 Description:
- A structural Verilog design that builds an 8-bit adder by connecting eight 1-bit Full Adders in series.
- Demonstrates hierarchical and modular RTL design principles.

### 🔧 Project 2: 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

#### 📘 Description:
- A behavioral Verilog design that performs ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, and SLT operations.
- Operation is selected using a 3-bit opcode.
- Designed with reusability and functional coverage in mind.

## 🛠️ Synopsys EDA Tools Used

This complete **RTL to GDSII digital IC design flow** is achieved with the help of the following **Synopsys EDA tools**:

### 🔹 **Synopsys VCS® (Verilog Compiler Simulator)**

> Used for compiling and simulating RTL code and testbenches. It verifies the functional correctness of the design before synthesis.

### 🔹 **Synopsys Verdi®**

> An advanced debugging platform used to analyze simulation waveforms, view design hierarchy, and trace signals across the design. Integrated with VCS for visual debugging.

### 🔹 **Synopsys Design Compiler®**

> Performs logic synthesis — converts Verilog RTL code into a technology-mapped gate-level netlist optimized for area, power, and timing.

### 🔹 **Synopsys IC Compiler™ (ICC)**

> A complete physical design tool used for:

* Floorplanning
* Power planning
* Placement
* Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
* Routing
* GDSII file generation
